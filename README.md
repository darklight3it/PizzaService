# Recruitment Excercise

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test :smiley:. The test consist in delivering us a simple application **on a github repository** of your own.
The test is intended as a **simplified simultation of our daily work**. As a team we put great importance to the **agile methodology**, for this reason the test is divided in **5 milestones**.

In each milestone you will be requested **to improve your code base** in order to meet business requirements. You have to complete the milestones **in order**, for example you can't jump on milestone 5, if you do not have completed the first four.

Do not worry if you can't complete all the milestones, we will review the test anyway and consider and take into account your experience.

## Rules and Hints

* The code base **must be deployed on github**. You can take advantage of [GIT tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) in order to show us the commit where you consider a milestone finished. Preferably do small and frequent commits.
* You can code it in any language you prefer.
* You can use any library you want.
* The output **must be a simple console application** (no html, forms, webviews, app etc...).
* You must complete the milestones **in order**.
* You **should cover** your code with Unit Test.
* Be open for change but do not overengineer your code.
